# Real-Time Security OS Event Logger

A Python-based security event monitoring tool with a minimalist GUI that tracks system processes and resource usage in real-time. The application provides alerts for suspicious activities and high resource usage, making it useful for system administrators and security professionals.

## Features

- 🔍 Real-time monitoring of system processes
- 📊 System resource usage tracking (CPU & Memory)
- 🚨 Anomaly detection for high CPU usage
- 🌓 Dark-themed minimalist GUI
- 🔍 Event filtering capabilities
- 📁 Export logs to CSV format
- 🔄 Automatic process history tracking

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- psutil library
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udayaryan0001/Real-time-Security-OS-event-logger.git
cd Real-time-Security-OS-event-logger
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

   - Filter dropdown to view specific types of events
   - Export button to save logs as CSV
   - Clear button to reset the log display
   - Real-time log display area
   - Status bar showing current state

3. The application automatically monitors:
   - Process CPU and memory usage
   - System-wide resource utilization
   - Anomalous process behavior

4. Use the filter dropdown to view:
   - All Events
   - Process Events
   - Resource Usage
   - Security Alerts

5. Export logs to CSV for further analysis

## Security Features

- Monitors CPU and memory usage of all processes
